# The DOM & Objects

*an Object is set of variables and functions created in order to make something usable in the real world.*
*Method: a function within an Object. This is used to create tasks associated with the Object.*
*Property: is a variable within a function. Properties includes keys and values
*Key: refers to the name of something inside of an object(name, hotel, room types, etc)
*Value: refers to whatever the key is ( a number, string, boolean, array)

## Literal Notation of an Object
1. an object is created with curly braces and the content (properties within it)
2. Keys and Values are seperated with a colon, followed by a comma after the value
3. in a method this. notation is used whenever you are indicated properties within *this* object.
4. Dot Notation is used when trying to call the property or method of an object. You do so by stating (objectname.key)
