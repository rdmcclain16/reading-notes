## What is a component?
- a component is a piece of portable, replaceable and reusable information intended to interact with other components with a webpage.

## Characteristics of Components
Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

## Props = short for Properties in React
- these properties are used for passing data from one component to the next.
- There are 3 Steps to Using Props in React:
  1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
  2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
  3. Finally, render the Props Data
  4. Note That* Props can only be passed one way(parent to child) and that it is read only info.
