# Functions and more!

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

The name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

Why Functions?
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

It looks like this:

function showMessage() {
  alert( 'Hello everyone!' );
}
