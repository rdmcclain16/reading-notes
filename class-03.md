# Lists, Boxes and Loops... oh my!

## Creating Lists in HTML
lists are used and needed alot when creating content on a webpage. There are different types of list you can create in HTML: an unordered list (shown with a bullet point),
an ordered list (shown with a 1,2,3 order) and a definition list (which shows a set of terms with a definition nestled under each term).
- An Ordered List uses the element (ol)
- An Unordered List used the element (ul)
- A Definition List uses the elements ( dl, dt and dd) DT stands for definition term and DD stands for Definition.

## CSS Boxes
CCS treats all HTML elements as if they have an imaginary box around them. This allows you to style the boxes and set certian properties to affect the apperance. 
- Border: seperates one box from another. You can change its border width, border style and border color
- Margin: margin sits outside of the edge of the border between two adjacent boxes
- Paddding: padding is the space inside the box between the border and the content within the box. This helps with readability.


## Loops
Loops check a condition that has been st. If its true, it will run a code block until it returns false and then it stops.
- For Loops: For Loops are used to set a specific code for a certain number of times. 
- While Loops: While Loops are used when you dont know how many times a code should run. The code will continue to run as its been set until a condition returns false.
- Do While Loops: this loop will run always run the statements or conditions inside a curly bracket even IF THE THE CONDITIONS TURNS FALSE.
