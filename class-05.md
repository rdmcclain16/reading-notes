# JPEG vs. GIF vs. PNG : the difference and when to use them

## Transparency:
1. JPEG: these images dont support transparency and should not be usable for that.
2. PNG: supports transparency in two ways (nserting an alpha channel that allows partial transparency or by declaring a single colour as transparent (index transparency)
3. GIF: support transparency by declaring a single colour in the colour palette as transparent (index transparency)

## Colors
1. JPEG: can support around 16 million colours
2. PNG: mainly have two modes â€” PNG8 and PNG24. PNG8 can support upto 256 colours whereas PNG24 can handle upto 16 million colours like a JPEG image. Use PNG8 for simple shapes with fewer colours and PNG24 for high quality, complex logos and shapes with rounded corners on a transparent background.
3. GIF: are limited to 256 colours

## Animation
1. GIF: only GIF supports annimation and is used for banners and ads. The other two cannot.
