* In this section, we learned about FOR and WHILE loops 

# My Key Takeaways
- Logical operators are comparison operators utlizing BOOLEAN language or (true or false statements)
- Loops refer to checking out a certain written condition to see if it is indeed true or false
- A loop consists of setting a variable, writing a condition of that variable and updating that variable once the outcome of the condition is met
- Here is an example of a for loop --> for (var i = 0; 1 < 10; i++) {
 document.write(i);}
