# Welcome To My World!

**Hi World, My name is Raven and I am a Front-End Web Developer**

One *very* important tool in being successful is having a **Growth** Mindset, instead of a ~~Fixed~~ Mindset!

A **Growth** mindset to me means to know that no matter what happens, you are more than enough and more than capable to succeed at anything you want to achieve. Embrace change because change *is* growth. Take the leap anyway and you'll be amazed at how far you soar.

## Three Keys to Keeping A Growth Mindset: ##
- Ackowledge the fear but have the courage to be fearless
- Remind yourself that you are enough: smart enough, strong enough & determined enough
- Rest and begin again, but never stop!

## In the words of Shonda Rhimes: ##

> You just have to keep moving forward. You just have to keep doing something, seizing the next opportunity, staying open to trying something new.
