## Wireframe Notes

*Today I learned that you must create a structure or guideline (referred to as wireframe or mockup) in order to grasp what the layout of the page should look like. 
*This helps you to better understand and see how a page will flow 
*Creating a low and high level mockup is needed in order to see how the functionality of the page will go and not just the design
