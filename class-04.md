Fixed CSS Positioning
Positioning in CSS provides designers and developers options for positioning HTML elements on a web page. 
The CSS position can be set to static, relative, absolute or fixed. When the CSS position has a value of fixed, it is set/pinned to a specific spot on a page. 
The fixed element stays the same regardless of scrolling. The navigation bar is a great example of an element that is often set to position:fixed;, enabling the user to scroll through the web page and still access the navigation bar.

CSS position: absolute
The value absolute for the CSS property position enables an element to ignore sibling elements and instead be positioned relative to its closest parent element that is positioned with relative or absolute. The absolute value removes an element entirely from the document flow. 
By using the positioning attributes top, left, bottom and right, an element can be positioned anywhere as expected.



CSS float property
The CSS float property determines how far left or how far right an element should float within its parent element. The value left floats an element to the left side of its container and the value right floats an element to the right side of its container. 
For the property float, the width of the container must be specified or the element will assume the full width of its containing element.
