# Key Takeaways of Markdown

**Here is a List of my Notes on Markdown in Github Pages:**

- Markdown is a way to style the text on your webpage
- Markdown allows you to use special characters such as ( #, *, !, [], >, etc) to create lists, bold, italicize, and strikethrough text, and more.
- Markdown is easy to read and allows you style and create content all on a single page
- Markdown is easy to read and thus easier to debug if not styled correctly
